# BrisJS-TypeScript

Demo app for BrisJS, showing TypeScript used in a life-like manner.

Setting up
----------
Fork, jump to the command line and do this:

```
npm install
bower install
tsd install
```

Yes, it assumes you have NodeJS installed.  Gulp, bower and tsd should also be installed globally.

Building
--------
Pretty simple. `gulp` will do it.  Use `gulp watch` if you're actively working on it

Running
-------
After building, open `index.html` in the `dist/` folder
